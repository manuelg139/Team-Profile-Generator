# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

Every organization needs a fast and efficient way to build a employee directory. This program was built for a busy HR professional that needs a way to build a directory web page. The goal of this app should be to reduce the amount of time it takes some one to build out a list of company employees. This app uses a variety of CS functionality, I ended up having to learn many things including OOP and regex to complete this app.
